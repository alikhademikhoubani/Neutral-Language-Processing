می‌شود، مانند مثال‌ها، تجارب مستقیم و یا دستور العمل‌ها، تا به یک الگو در داده‌ها برسند و بر اساس این مثال‌هایی که ارائه می‌دهیم، تصمیمات بهتری بگیرند. هدف اصلی آن است که به کامپیوتر این اجازه را

ماشین و هوش مصنوعی است. مدل‌های یادگیری عمیق، بسیار قدرتمندند و به خصوص زمانی که داده‌ها پیچیده و حجیم هستند، عملکرد بهتری نسبت به الگوریتم‌های کلاسیک از خود نشان می‌دهند. یادگیری عمیق زیرشاخه‌ای از هوش مصنوعی و یادگیری ماشین است که در آن از شبکه‌های عصبی مصنوعی (با بیش از سه لایه) برای پیش‌بینی استفاده می‌شود. شبکه‌های عصبی عمیق با الهام‌گیری از مغز انسان ساخته شده‌اند و با دیدن نمونه‌های مختلف از داده یاد می‌گیرند چطور پیش‌بینی کنند.\n\nمدل زبانی بزرگ نوعی برنامه هوش مصنوعی است که می‌تواند زبان انسان یا دیگر مجموعه داده‌های پیچیده را تفسیر کند. این مدل‌ها بر پایه یادگیری ماشین و نوعی شبکه عصبی به نام ترنسفورمر  توسعه می‌یابند. مدل‌های زبان بزرگ برای درک ارتباط بین حروف، کلمات و جملات، از نوعی یادگیری ماشین به نام یادگیری عمیق استفاده می‌کنند. یادگیری عمیق به مدل امکان می‌دهد که ازطریق

روش کلی کار به این صورت است که پردازش زبان طبیعی زبان شناسی و مدل سازی مبتنی بر قوانین زبان انسانی را با مدلهای آماری، یادگیری ماشین و یادگیری عمیق ترکیب می‌کند. این فناوری‌ها با هم، رایانه‌ها را قادر می‌سازند تا زبان انسان را در قالب متن پردازش کنند و در نهایت معنای دقیق را با هدف و احساسات نویسنده «درک» کنند. پردازش زبان طبیعی زمینه‌ای است که بر تعامل بین علم داده و زبان طبیعی میان انسان‌ها تمرکز می‌کند و در صنایع زیادی در حال گسترش است. امروزه پردازش زبان طبیعی به لطف پیشرفت‌های عظیم در دسترسی به داده‌ها و افزایش قدرت محاسباتی به جنبه‌های مختلف زندگی وارد می‌شود. برای مثال پردازش زبان طبیعی

و پنالتی نیز به آن افزوده می‌شود. فوتبال ضوابطی دارد که قوانین فوتبال نامیده می‌شوند و نمی‌توان برخلاف آن‌ها عمل کرد. سازمان فیفا، علاوه بر فوتبال، نهاد رسمی ورزش‌های فوتسال و فوتبال ساحلی نیز هست و
