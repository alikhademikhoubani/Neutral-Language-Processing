اگر شخص به‌صورت **عمدی** (قصد داشتن) چیزی بخورد یا بنوشد، روزه‌اش باطل می‌شود.  \n   - اگر به‌دلیل سهو یا فراموشی بخورد/بنوشد، روزه باطل نمی‌شود.  \n   در مورد ضعف، اگر فرد به‌دلیل ناتوانی جسمی (مثلاً نمی‌تواند غذا یا دارو را به‌صورت خوراکی مصرف کند) مجبور شود که داروی خوراکی یا مایعی بخورد، این عمل **عمدی** است؛ بنابراین روزه باطل می‌شود و باید قضا شود. اما اگر به‌دلیل فراموشی یا سهو خورده باشد، روزه باقی می‌ماند.\n\n4. **موارد خاصی که خوردن/نوشیدن باعث باطل شدن نمی‌شود**  \n   متن به برخی موارد جزئی (مثلاً فرو بردن آب دهان، یا قطره‌های بسیار کوچک) اشاره دارد که باعث باطل شدن روزه نمی‌شوند؛ اما این موارد صرفاً برای «مصرف غیر عمدی» یا «مقدار ناچیز» است و در شرایط ضعف که نیاز به دریافت مواد مغذی یا دارو به‌صورت واضح و عمدی است، این استثناها اعمال نمی‌شوند.\n\n---\n\n### خلاصهٔ پاسخ\n\n- **اگر ضعف یا بیماری باعث خطر برای سلامتی شود** (مثلاً خطر افت فشار خون، تشدید بیماری، ناتوانی در ادامهٔ روزه)، **مجوز شکستن روزه وجود دارد** و پس از بهبود باید روزهٔ قضا شود.  \n- این تصمیم می‌تواند بر پایهٔ **تشخیص پزشکی معتبر** باشد؛ در غیر این صورت، فرد باید ابتدا ارزیابی کند که آیا واقعاً ضرری وجود دارد یا نه.  \n- در صورتی که فرد صرفاً «احساس ضعف» داشته باشد اما هیچ خطر واضحی برای سلامتی‌اش وجود نداشته باشد، باید سعی کند روزه را ادامه دهد؛ خوردن یا نوشیدن عمدی در این حالت روزه را باطل می‌کند و قضا می‌شود.  \n\nبنابراین، **بله**؛ انسان می‌تواند به‌دلیل ضعف (به‌شرط آنکه این ضعف باعث ضرر واقعی به بدن شود) روزه‌اش را بشکند و پس از بهبود آن را قضا کند. در غیر این صورت، صرفاً احساس ضعف بدون خطر جدی، مانع ادامهٔ روزه نمی‌شود.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":36},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(generate_response(\"روزه کسی که مسافر است چگونه می باشد؟\"))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-26T16:56:31.598259Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-26T16:56:31.599077Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-26T16:56:34.495092Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-26T16:56:31.599050Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-26T16:56:34.494323Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"**خلاصهٔ حکم روزهٔ مسافر در ماه رمضان (بر پایهٔ متن ارائه‌شده)**  \n\n| نکته | توضیح |\n|------|--------|\n| **اجازهٔ سفر** | سفر در ماه رمضان حتی اگر هدف فرار از روزه باشد، جایز است؛ ولی ترجیحاً باید از سفر خودداری کرد مگر اینکه برای کار نیکو یا ضرورت باشد. |\n| **اعتبار روزهٔ مسافر** | اگر مسافر قصد داشته باشد در سفر روزه بگیرد (بدون نذر یا قصد خاص)، روزهٔ او **صحیح** است؛ یعنی می‌تواند همان‌طور که معمولاً روزه می‌گیرد، روزه بگیرد. |\n| **شکست روزه** | 1. اگر روزه به‌دلیل خوردن، آشامیدن، جماع، استمنا، دروغ به خدا/پیامبران، رساندن غبار به حلق، فرو بردن تمام سر در آب یا باقی ماندن بر جنابت/حیض/نفاس تا اذان صبح (مفطرات) شکسته شود، **باید قضا کند**.  <br>2. اگر روزه پس از ظهر (بعد از ظهرِ ظهر) شکسته شود، **قضا نمی‌شود**؛ یعنی آن روزه از دست رفته است و نمی‌توان آن را جبران کرد. |\n| **قضای روزهٔ مستحب یا واجب غیرمعین** | اگر مسافر تصمیم بگیرد روزهٔ مستحب یا روزهٔ واجب غیرمعین (که وجوبش به روز خاصی محدود نیست) را قطع کند، ولی کاری که روزه را باطل می‌کند (مثلاً خوردن) انجام ندهد، و سپس **قبل از ظهر** (برای روزهای مستحب تا غروب) نیت روزه کند، روزهٔ او **صحیح** است. |\n| **نذر یا قصد خاص (مثلاً اقامت ۱۰ روز در مکه)** | اگر مسافر نذر کرده باشد که در سفر روزه بگیرد یا قصد داشته باشد ۱۰ روز در مکه بماند و سپس به اعتکاف در مسجد الحرام بپردازد: <br>• او باید **دو روز** روزه بگیرد، سپس با **روز سوم** (که به‌صورت کامل) اعتکاف خود را تکمیل کند. <br>• اگر نذر یا قصد اقامت نداشته باشد، روزهٔ او در سفر **صحیح نیست** و به‌همین دلیل اعتکاف نیز صحیح نیست. |\n| **قضای روزهای شکسته** | برای روزهای شکسته (به‌جز مواردی که پس از ظهر شکسته شده باشد) مسافر همان‌طور که معمولاً می‌کند، باید آن روزها را **قضا** کند؛ یعنی در هر روزی که توانست پس از عید افطار (یا هر زمان دیگری) روزه بگیرد، آن روز را جبران می‌کند. |\n| **نکتهٔ عملی** | -

قضای روزه**\n\nقضای روزه به معنای جبران روزهای رمضان است که به دلایل مشروع (مانند بیماری، سفر، حائض بودن، نداشتن توان جسمی یا عقل) گرفته نشده‌اند. نکات اصلی این حکم عبارتند از:\n\n1. **وجوب قضای روزه**  \n   - هر کس که به دلیل بیماری یا مسافرت، یا هر دلیل شرعی دیگری که او را از گرفتن روزه معذور می‌کند، روزه‌ای را در رمضان نگرفته باشد، موظف است آن روزها را **قضا** کند.  \n   - قضا باید پیش از پایان ماه رمضان سال بعد انجام شود؛ یعنی قبل از شروع رمضان بعدی باید تمام روزهای گمشده جبران شوند.  \n\n2. **شرایط صحت قضای روزه**  \n   - برای اینکه قضای روزه معتبر باشد، شخص باید شرایط صحت روزه را داشته باشد: **بلوغ، عقل، توان جسمی، عدم حائض بودن، عدم وجود ضرر برای بدن** و غیره. این همان شرایطی است که برای گرفتن روزه لازم است.  \n\n3. **فدیّه برای کسانی که قادر به قضا نیستند**  \n   - اگر بیماری یا وضعیت جسمی فرد به گونه‌ای باشد که حتی پس از پایان رمضان سال بعد نیز نتواند روزهای گمشده را قضا کند، **فدیّه** (پرداخت مقدار معینی غذا یا پول به یک نفر نیازمند برای هر روزی که نتوانست قضا کند) واجب می‌شود.  \n   - فدیّه بر خود فرد معذور است و هیچ‌کس دیگری (مانند شوهر) مسئول پرداخت آن نیست.  \n\nبه طور خلاصه، هر کس به دلایل مشروع روزه‌ای را در رمضان نگرفته باشد، باید آن روزها را پیش از رمضان بعدی قضا کند؛ در صورتی که به دلیل بیماری مزمن یا عدم توان جسمی نتواند قضا کند، فدیّه به جای قضا واجب می‌شود.  \n\n**منابع**  \n- شرایط وجوب و صحت روزه و ضرورت قضای آن: «۲ .روزه ی قضا… ۴ .شرایط

فقه اسلامی روزه‌ها به چند دستهٔ اصلی تقسیم می‌شوند. بر پایهٔ متونی که در اختیار داریم می‌توان این دسته‌ها را به‌صورت زیر خلاصه کرد:\n\n| شماره | نوع روزه | توضیح مختصر |\n|------|----------|--------------|\n| ۱ | **روزهٔ واجب** | روزه‌ای که بر مسلمان بالغ، عاقل، سالم و غیرمسافر واجب است. شامل موارد زیر می‌شود: <br>‑ روزهٔ ماه مبارک رمضان <br>‑ روزهٔ قضا (جبران روزهای از دست رفتهٔ رمضان) <br>‑ روزهٔ کفاره (برای جبران گناهان خاص) <br>‑ روزهٔ قضای پدر و مادر (به‌دلیل نذر یا وعده) <br>‑ روزهٔ مستحب که به‌واسطهٔ نذر، عهد یا قسم واجب شده است <br>‑ روزهٔ سوم از ایام اعتکاف <br>‑ روزهٔ بدل از قربانی در حج تمتع |\n| ۲ | **روزهٔ مستحب (اختیاری)** | روزه‌ای که انجام آن مستحب است ولی واجب نیست. مثال‌های معروف: روزهٔ دوشنبه‑چهارشنبه، روزهٔ عاشورا، روزهٔ یلدا، روزهٔ سیزده‌به‌دوشنبه و سایر روزهای مستحب که فرد می‌تواند به نیت روزه آن‌ها را بگیرد. |\n| ۳ | **روزهٔ قضا (جبران)** | روزه‌ای که برای جبران روزهای از دست رفتهٔ رمضان (به‌دلیل بیماری، سفر، عذرهای مشروع و …) گرفته می‌شود. این روزه در اصل جزو «روزهٔ واجب» است، اما به‌عنوان یک نوع خاص (قضا) شناخته می‌شود. |\n| ۴ | **روزهٔ کفاره** | روزه‌ای که به‌عنوان کفارهٔ گناهان یا تخلفاتی خاص (مانند زنا، قتل، یا عدم انجام فریضهٔ حج) واجب می‌شود. معمولاً به‌صورت ۶۰ روز متوالی یا دو ماه متناوب (هر ماه ۳۰ روز) است. |\n| ۵ | **روزهٔ بدل (جایگزین)** | روزه‌ای که به‌جای قربانی در برخی احکام حج (به‌ویژه حج تمتع) گرفته می‌شود. این نوع روزه در فهرست «روزه‌های واجب» آمده است. |\n| ۶ | **روزهٔ نذر/عهد/قسم** | روزه‌ای که به‌دلیل نذر، عهد یا قسم به‌صورت شخصی یا جمعی واجب می‌شود. پس از انجام نذر یا عهد، روزهٔ مربوطه تبدیل به «روزهٔ مستحب» می‌شود که دیگر می‌توان آن را به‌صورت واجب انجام داد. |\n\n### جمع‌بندی\nبه‌طور کلی می‌توان گفت **شش نوع اصلی** روزه در فقه وجود دارد:\n\n1. **روزهٔ واجب** (شامل تمام مواردی که در فهرست بالا آمده)\n2. **روزهٔ مستحب (اختیاری)**\n3. **روزهٔ قضا (جبران)**\n4. **روزهٔ کفاره**\n5. **روزهٔ بدل (جایگزین)**\n6. **روزهٔ نذر/عهد/قسم**\n\nهر یک از این انواع شرایط خاص خود را دارند (مانند نیت، عدم وجود مفطرات، داشتن صلاحیت‌های شرعی) که برای صحت روزه باید رعایت شوند. اگر این شرایط برآورده شود، روزهٔ موردنظر صحیح و مقبول خواهد بود.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":62},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(generate_response3(\"روزه های واجب را نام

ضعف روزه را بشکنید. فقه می‌گوید:  \n   > «انسان نمی‌تواند به خاطر ضعف روزه را بخورد…»\n\n2. **ضعف شدید که تحمل آن بسیار مشکل باشد** – وقتی ضعف به حدی رسیده باشد که ادامهٔ روزه برای شما به‌طور واقعی دشوار یا خطرناک شود (مثلاً بیماری‌ای که باعث کم‌خونی شدید، افت فشار خون، تشنج، یا هر وضعیتی می‌شود که ادامهٔ روزه می‌تواند به سلامت شما آسیب برساند)، **اجازهٔ شکستن روزه وجود دارد**. این حالت در متن

یا ضرر، باید روزهٔ گمشده را در روزهای دیگر (قضا) یا در موارد خاص (مثلاً روزهای واجب) کفارهٔ آن را انجام داد.  \n- **مشورت با پزشک**: اگر شک دارید که وضعیت جسمی‌تان به حدی است که روزه برایتان خطرناک است، بهتر است با یک پزشک یا متخصص فقه مشورت کنید. گفتهٔ پزشکان که «اگر اطمینان‌آور باشد یا باعث خوف ضرر شود» معتبر است؛ در غیر این صورت، صرفاً بر پایهٔ احساس شخصی نمی‌توان تصمیم گرفت.  \n- **عدم استفاده از مواد مخدر یا داروهای تزریقی خوراکی**: در زمان روزه، استفاده از آمپول‌های خوراکی یا موادی که از طریق بینی یا زیر زبان جذب می‌شوند، نیز ممنوع است؛ اما تزریق عضلانی یا موضعی مشکلی ایجاد نمی‌کند.\n\n### خلاصه\n\n- **ضعف معمول** → روزه باید حفظ شود.  \n- **ضعف شدید یا خطر برای سلامتی** → می‌توان روزه را شکست (قضا یا کفاره بعداً).  \n\nبنابراین، انسان فقط وقتی می‌تواند به خاطر ضعف روزه

شوهر او نیست؛ فدیه بر خود زن است. |\n| **کودک، دیوانه، بیهوش، مسافر، حائض/نفاس، یا کسی که روزه برای او ضرر یا حرج دارد** | این افراد **قضای** روزه ندارند؛ فقط در مواردی که عذر موقت باشد (مثلاً مسافرت کوتاه) می‌توانند پس از رفع عذر قضای کنند. | برای افراد زیر سن بلوغ (تقریباً ۹‑۱۰ سال قمری) روزه واجب نیست؛ اگر به‌دلیل ضعف یا مشقت زیاد روزه را بشکنند، مجاز است. |\n\n---\n\n#### ۲. کفارهٔ تأخیر (فدیه) برای قضای روزه\n\n- **هر روزی که قضای به تعویق بیفتد** (یعنی پس از ماه رمضان فعلی، ولی قبل از ماه رمضان بعدی) **باید فدیه** (معمولاً یک روز غذا برای یک مسکین) پرداخت شود.\n- در حالت **عذر مستمر** (مثلاً بیماری که تا رمضان بعدی ادامه دارد) **فقط فدیه** کافی است؛ قضای لازم نیست.\n\n---\n\n#### ۳. زمان انجام قضای\n\n1. **قبل از ماه رمضان بعدی**: قضای باید پیش از شروع ماه رمضان سال بعد تکمیل شود؛ در غیر این صورت، پس از آن فقط فدیه کافی است (در صورتی که عذر همچنان ادامه داشته باشد).\n2. **قضای می‌تواند به‌صورت روز به روز یا جمعی** (مثلاً چند روز را یک‌جا قضا کرد) انجام شود؛ شرط این است که هر روز به‌صورت کامل (از سحر تا غروب) نگه داشته شود.\n\n---\n\n#### ۴. نیت و صحت قضای\n\n- برای **قضای روزهای واجب** (مانند روزهای رمضان) باید همان نیت را داشته باشید که برای روزهای اصلی داشتید: «من این روز را به‌خاطر قضا روزهای رمضان می‌گذرانم».\n- اگر در طول روز قضای، **عملی که روزه را باطل می‌کند** (مثلاً خوردن، آشامیدن، جماع، استمناء، دروغ به خدا، ... – همان‌طور که در فهرست «مفطرات روزه» آمده) انجام ندهید، قضای صحیح است.\n- اگر به‌صورت ناخواسته (مثلاً فراموشی) روزه شکسته شود، باید همان‌طور که برای روزهای اصلی عمل می‌شود، **قضای** یا **فدیه** (در صورت وجود عذر) انجام داد.\n\n---\n\n#### ۵. موارد خاص\n\n| مورد | حکم قضای | نکته |\n|------|----------|------|\n| **بیماری که تا رمضان بعدی ادامه دارد** | **قضای لازم نیست**؛ فقط فدیه. | این حالت به‌عنوان «عذر مستمر» شناخته می‌شود. |\n| **سفر طولانی که تا قبل از رمضان بعدی ادامه دارد** | اگر سفر تا قبل از رمضان بعدی تمام شود، می‌توان قضای کرد؛ در غیر این صورت فقط فدیه. | سفر به‌عنوان عذر موقت در نظر گرفته می‌شود؛ پس از پایان سفر می‌توان قضای کرد. |\n| **قضای روزهای مستحب یا غیرمعین** | اگر تصمیم به قطع روزه بگیرید ولی عمل باطل‌کننده‌ای انجام ندهید و قبل از ظهر (برای واجب) یا قبل از غروب (برای مستحب) نیت کنید، روزه صحیح است. | این نکته برای روزهای غیررسمی (مثلاً روزهای مستحب) نیز صادق است. |\n\n---\n\n#### ۶. خلاصهٔ عملی\n\n1. **اگر به‌دلیل عذر موقت (بیماری کوتاه‌مدت، سفر، …) روزه نگرفتید:**  \n   - **قضای** روزهای از دست رفته را انجام دهید.  \n   - برای هر روزی که قضای به تعویق افتاد، **فدیه** (کفارهٔ تأخیر) بدهید.\n\n2. **اگر عذر شما طولانی/پایدار است (بیماری مزمن که تا رمضان بعدی ادامه دارد):**  \n   - **قضای** لازم نیست؛ فقط **فدیه** برای هر روزی که روزه نگرفتید بدهید.\n\n3. **اگر شما (یا همسرتان) در شرایطی هستید که روزه برایتان ضرر یا حرج دارد (حاملگی، نوزاد، دیوانگی، …):**  \n   - روزه واجب نیست؛ در صورت عدم توانایی، فقط فدیه می‌پردازید.\n\n4. **نیت و رعایت مفطرات:**  \n   - برای هر روز قضای، نیت «قضای روزهای رمضان» داشته باشید.  \n   - از انجام هر یک از مواردی که روزه را باطل می‌کند (خوردن، آشامیدن، جماع، استمناء، دروغ به خدا، …) خودداری کنید.\n\n---\n\n### نتیجه‌گیری\n\nقضای روزه یک فریضهٔ شرعی است که در صورت عدم توانایی موقت برای نگه داشتن روزه (به‌دلیل عذر شرعی) باید انجام شود. در عین حال، اگر عذر به‌صورت مستمر ادامه یابد، فدیه (کفارهٔ تأخیر) کافی است و قضای لازم نیست. رعایت نیت صحیح، انجام قضای پیش از رمضان بعدی، و اجتناب از مفطرات، از اصول کلیدی برای صحت قضای روزه محسوب می‌شوند.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":66},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(generate_response3(\"واکسن کرونا

فقه اسلامی روزه‌ها به چند دستهٔ اصلی تقسیم می‌شوند. بر پایهٔ متونی که در اختیار داریم می‌توان این دسته‌ها را به‌صورت زیر خلاصه کرد:\n\n| شماره | نوع روزه | توضیح مختصر |\n|------|----------|--------------|\n| ۱ | **روزهٔ واجب** | روزه‌ای که بر مسلمان بالغ، عاقل، سالم و غیرمسافر واجب است. شامل موارد زیر می‌شود: <br>‑ روزهٔ ماه مبارک رمضان <br>‑ روزهٔ قضا (جبران روزهای رمضان که از دست رفته‌اند) <br>‑ روزهٔ کفاره (برای جبران گناهان یا تخلفاتی مثل زنا) <br>‑ روزهٔ قضای پدر و مادر (به‌دلیل نذر یا وعدهٔ والدین) <br>‑ روزهٔ مستحب که به‌واسطهٔ نذر، عهد یا قسم واجب شده است <br>‑ روزهٔ سوم از ایام اعتکاف <br>‑ روزهٔ بدل از قربانی در حج تمتع |\n| ۲ | **روزهٔ مستحب (اختیاری)** | روزه‌ای که بر مسلمان واجب نیست، اما انجام آن مستحب و پاداش‌دار است. مثال‌های رایج: روزهٔ دوشنبه‑چهارشنبه، روزهٔ سیزده‌ام ماه (یوم‌الثلث)، روزهٔ عاشورا، روزهٔ ایام‌نظام (یوم‌الفضیلت) و … |\n| ۳ | **روزهٔ قضا (جبران)** | روزه‌ای که برای جبران روزهای واجب (معمولاً روزهای رمضان) که به‌دلیل بیماری، سفر یا هر عذر دیگری نگه‌داشته نشده‌اند، گرفته می‌شود. این روزها در فهرست «روزه‌های واجب» به‌عنوان «روزهٔ قضا» ذکر شده‌اند. |\n| ۴ | **روزهٔ کفاره** | روزه‌ای که به‌جای پرداخت کفاره (مثلاً صد روز یا صد گوسفند) به‌منظور رفع گناه یا تخلف خاصی (مانند زنا یا خوردن گوشت حرام) گرفته می‌شود. |\n| ۵ | **روزهٔ بدل (جایگزین)** | در برخی موارد (مانند حج تمتع) به‌جای قربانی کردن، روزه‌ای به‌عنوان بدل گرفته می‌شود. این نوع روزه در فهرست «روزه‌های واجب» تحت عنوان «روزهٔ بدل از قربانی در حج تمتع» آمده است. |\n| ۶ | **روزهٔ نذر/عهد/قسم** | روزه‌ای که به‌دلیل نذر، عهد یا قسم به‌دست می‌آید و از آن پس واجب می‌شود؛ یعنی اگر شخصی نذر کند «یک روزی روزه بگیرم»، آن روزه تبدیل به «روزهٔ مستحبی که به واسطهٔ نذر و عهد و قسم واجب شده است» می‌شود. |\n\n### جمع‌بندی\nبه‌طور کلی می‌توان گفت **شش نوع اصلی** روزه وجود دارد:\n\n1. **روزهٔ واجب** (با زیرشاخه‌های مختلف مثل رمضان، قضا، کفاره، …)  \n2. **روزهٔ مستحب** (اختیاری)  \n3. **روزهٔ قضا** (جبران)  \n4. **روزهٔ کفاره** (جبران گناه)  \n5. **روزهٔ بدل** (جایگزین قربانی)  \n6. **روزهٔ نذر/عهد/قسم** (به‌دلیل وعده یا نذر)\n\nهر یک از این انواع شرایط خاص خود را دارند (مانند نیت، عدم وجود مفطرات، داشتن صلاحیت‌های شرعی) که در متن فوق به‌تفصیل آمده است. اگر سؤال خاصی دربارهٔ یکی از این انواع دارید، خوشحال می‌شوم بیشتر توضیح دهم.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":75},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(generate_response4(\"واکسن کرونا
