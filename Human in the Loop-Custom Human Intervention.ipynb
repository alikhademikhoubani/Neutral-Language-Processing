The 2017 paper *“Attention Is All You Need”* introduced the Transformer model, which has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning as a whole. It replaced traditional models that relied heavily on recurrence and convolution. In this blog, I will break down the key ideas from the paper into digestible parts, offering a simplified summary while retaining a technical touch. Before this paper, most NLP models were based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. * **Limited parallelism**: RNNs process data sequentially, which makes them slow for long sequences. The authors of *“Attention Is All You Need”* proposed the **Transformer**, a model that relies entirely on the mechanism of **attention** without using any recurrence or convolution. This model efficiently handles long-range dependencies, can be trained faster, and processes input in parallel, making it groundbreaking for modern AI. Simplifying tech, Building the future 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Tech Enthusiast with 10+ Years of experience in software design, AWS Cloud, AI and many more.', 'The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer \"Transformer (machine learning model)\"), based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau *et al.* It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, and a main contributor to the AI boom, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of a wide variety of AI, such as large language models. Seq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them from being accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, *decomposable attention* applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude fewer parameters than LSTMs. One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention *without* recurrence would be sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is *all* you need\".', 'By focusing on attention mechanisms, the Transformer architecture overcomes the limitations of traditional RNN and CNN models, enabling more efficient and effective sequence processing. • Self-Attention Mechanism: This allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when processing each word, capturing contextual relationships. 1. Self-Attention Mechanism: This allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when processing each word, capturing contextual relationships. In summary, attention mechanisms in the Transformer allow the model to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence, capturing both local and long-range dependencies. As we continue to explore and expand upon the Transformer architecture, it’s worth reflecting on the elegant simplicity of the core idea: that attention — the ability to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input — is all you need to build powerful sequence processing models.', \"View a PDF of the paper titled Attention Is All You Need, by Ashish Vaswani and 7 other authors. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. | Cite as: | arXiv:1706.03762 [cs.CL] |. |  | (or  arXiv:1706.03762v7 [cs.CL] for this version) |. **** Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:57:34 UTC (1,102 KB). **** Mon, 19 Jun 2017 16:49:45 UTC (1,125 KB). **[v7]** Wed, 2 Aug 2023 00:41:18 UTC (1,124 KB).

In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [25] representations. 7 Conclusion In this work, we presented the Transformer, the ﬁrst sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.'], 'arxiv_data': 'Published: 2023-10-25\\nTitle: Topological Complexity Related To Multi-Valued Functions\\nAuthors: Melih İs\\nSummary: In this paper, we deal with the robot motion planning problem in multi-valued function theory.

We also introduced the generalized version of the relative topological complexity of a topological pair on both the Schwarz genus and the homotopic distance. With these concepts, we give some inequalities including the topological complexity and the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, the most important parts of the study of robot motion planning in topology.

Moreover, we examine the properties of the discrete TC number in higher dimensions and its relationship with scat.
