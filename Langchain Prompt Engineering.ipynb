your acting financial advisor, I'd be happy to explain the basics of income tax in a simple and easy-to-understand way.\n\n**What is Income Tax?**\n\nIncome tax is a type of tax that the government collects from individuals and businesses on the money they earn. It's like a fee for living and working in a country. The government uses this money to fund public services, infrastructure, and social programs that benefit everyone.\n\n**How Does Income Tax Work?**\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **You Earn Money**: You get a job, start a business, or receive income from other sources, such as investments or rent.\n2. **You Report Your Income**: You tell the government how much money you earned during the year. This is usually done by filing a tax return.\n3. **Taxable Income**: The government calculates your taxable income, which is the amount of money you earned minus any deductions or exemptions you're eligible for.\n4. **Tax Rate**: The government applies a tax rate to your taxable income. The tax rate is like a percentage of your income that you have to pay in taxes.\n5. **You Pay Taxes**: You pay the calculated amount of taxes to the government.\n\n**Types of Income Tax**\n\nThere are two main types of income tax:\n\n1. **Progressive Tax**: This means that the more you earn, the higher tax rate you pay. For example, if you earn $50,000, you might pay 20% in taxes, but if you earn $100,000, you might pay 30% in taxes.\n2. **Flat Tax**: This means that everyone pays the same tax rate, regardless of how much they earn.\n\n**Tax Deductions and Exemptions**\n\nTax deductions and exemptions can help reduce the amount of taxes you owe. These are expenses or income that are not subject to tax, such as:\n\n* Charitable donations\n* Mortgage interest\n* Medical expenses\n* Retirement savings contributions\n\n**Why Do We Need Income Tax?**\n\nIncome tax is necessary to fund public goods and services that benefit everyone, such as:\n\n* Roads and infrastructure\n* Education and healthcare\n* National defense\n* Social welfare programs\n\nIn summary, income tax is a fee on the money you earn, and it's used to fund public services and programs. The government calculates your taxable income, applies a tax rate, and you pay the resulting amount in taxes. By understanding the basics of income tax, you can better manage your finances and make informed decisions about your money.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about income tax or would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt_template = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables = [\"sentence\", \"target_language\"],\n    template = \"In an easy way translate the following sentence '{sentence}' into {target_language}.\"\n)\nprompt_template.format(sentence = \"How are you?\", target_language = \"Persian\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T16:01:35.724528Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T16:01:35.724813Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T16:01:35.729985Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T16:01:35.724795Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T16:01:35.729402Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":18,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"\"In an easy way translate the following sentence 'How are you?' into Persian.\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"code","source":"second_chain = LLMChain(llm = llm, prompt = prompt_template)\nresponse = second_chain({\"sentence\": \"Hello how are you\", \"target_language\": \"persian\"})\nprint(response)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T16:05:15.587650Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T16:05:15.588385Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T16:05:16.147110Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T16:05:15.588360Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T16:05:16.146566Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"{'sentence': 'Hello how are you', 'target_language': 'persian', 'text': 'The translation of \"Hello, how are you?\" in Persian is:\\n\\n\"سلام، چطوری؟\"\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown:\\n\\n* \"سلام\" (salām) means \"hello\"\\n* \"چطوری\" (chetori) means \"how are you\"\\n\\nSo, when you put them together, you get \"سلام، چطوری؟\" (salām, chetori), which is a common way to greet someone in Persian.'}\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"examples = [\n    {\"word\": \"happy\", \"antonym\": \"sad\"},\n    {\"word\": \"tall\", \"antonym\": \"short\"}\n]\n\nexample_formatter_template = \"\"\"Word: {word}\nAntonym: {antonym}\n\"\"\"\n\nexample_prompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables = [\"word\", \"antonym\"],\n    template = example_formatter_template\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T16:16:02.735562Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T16:16:02.735872Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T16:16:02.739981Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T16:16:02.735852Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T16:16:02.739276Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"few_shot_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(\n    examples = examples,\n    example_prompt = example_prompt,\n    prefix = \"Give the antonym of every input\\n\",\n    suffix = \"Word: {input}\\nAntonym: \",\n    input_variables = [\"input\"],\n    example_separator = \"\\n\"\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T16:16:07.835689Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T16:16:07.836408Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T16:16:07.839997Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T16:16:07.836385Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T16:16:07.839197Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(few_shot_prompt.format(input = \"big\"))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T16:18:27.366373Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T16:18:27.366935Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T16:18:27.370796Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T16:18:27.366913Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T16:18:27.369992Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Give the antonym of every input\n\nWord: happy\nAntonym: sad\n\nWord: tall\nAntonym: short\n\nWord: big\nAntonym: \n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"code","source":"chain = LLMChain(llm = llm, prompt = few_shot_prompt)\nresponse = chain({\"input\": \"big\"})\nprint(response)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T16:20:01.506082Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T16:20:01.506711Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T16:20:01.936051Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T16:20:01.506687Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T16:20:01.935255Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"{'input': 'big', 'text': 'The antonym of \"big\" is small.'}\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27}]}
