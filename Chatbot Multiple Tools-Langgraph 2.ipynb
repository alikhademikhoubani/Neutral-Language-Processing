Let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out which tool to use. The available tools are arxiv, wikipedia, and tavily_search. Since the user is asking for recent research, arxiv is a good choice because it\\'s a repository for academic papers, especially in fields like computer science and artificial intelligence. Wikipedia might not have the most up-to-date information on very recent studies. Tavily search could also be useful, but if the focus is on academic papers, arxiv is more direct.\\n\\nThe user\\'s query is about \"recent researches,\" so I should look for papers published in the last few years. The arxiv function requires a search query. The query should be specific enough to retrieve relevant papers. Possible search terms could be \"large language models recent advances\" or \"state of the art large language models 2023-2024.\" I need to make sure the query captures the essence of recent research. Maybe \"recent advancements in large language models\" would work.\\n\\nI should structure the arxiv search to get the most recent papers. Let me check the parameters again. The function takes a \"query\" parameter as a string. So, I\\'ll construct the query to include terms related to recent developments. Perhaps including years like 2023 or 2024 might help, but arxiv\\'s search might handle date ranges. However, the function\\'s parameters don\\'t mention date filtering, so maybe just using keywords related to recent advancements is better.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants summaries of the latest papers. The arxiv tool would return the papers, and then I can present the titles, authors, and summaries. Since the user didn\\'t specify a particular subfield, the search should be broad enough to cover various aspects of large language models, like training methods, applications, efficiency, etc.\\n\\nWait, the user might be interested in both technical and applied research. The query should be general enough to include different areas. Maybe \"recent research large language models 2023\" as the search term. That should fetch the latest papers from the past year.
